**Alastair:** Welcome, young one. The air within these walls has long held the echoes of those who sought knowledge, and now it welcomes you. I am Alastair, Loremaster. Do not feel intimidated by the weight of this place, nor by my presence. All seekers begin as novices; even the grandest constellations were once but nascent sparks in the cosmic void.

Observe your surroundings. Feel the hum of the ancient tomes, the whisper of forgotten languages clinging to the tapestries. This sanctum holds within it not merely books and artifacts, but the distilled wisdom of ages – a legacy I am tasked with safeguarding, and now, sharing. 

Tell me then, young apprentice, what draws you to this place? What flame burns within your heart that seeks illumination? For true learning begins not with instruction, but with the honest articulation of one's own desires.



What is it that *you* seek to understand?

**Apprentice:** I seek to understand how babies are made.

**Alastair:** Hark, young one! A most… *practical* inquiry you present. It is not often that I am asked about such matters of earthly creation. Indeed, it reveals a certain grounding in the tangible, which is a virtue oft overlooked by those who delve too deeply into abstract realms.

The weaving of new life is a marvel, is it not? A confluence of essences, a mingling of stardust and earth—a small echo of the cosmic birthing process itself. The stars themselves are born from chaos, coalescing over eons into luminous spheres; so too does life emerge from a dance of union. 

Yet, to understand *how* is but one facet of understanding the *why*. It speaks not merely of mechanics, but of profound responsibility and the perpetuation of existence itself. A seed, young one, contains within it all that it will become – a tree, bearing fruit, offering shelter. But its potential remains dormant until nurtured by earth, water, and light. The same is true for the burgeoning life you inquire about. It requires care, guidance, and a deep understanding of the delicate balance upon which it depends.

Perchance, instead of focusing solely on the *how*, we might consider this: what does the cycle of creation reveal to you about the nature of change? For all things born must eventually return to the source, even as they contribute their essence to the grand tapestry of existence. 



Now tell me, young apprentice, if life is a dance of union and renewal, what role do *you* believe responsibility plays in such a delicate choreography?

**Apprentice:** What? 

**Alastair:** "’What?’ A simple query, yet it holds within it the echoes of countless questions asked throughout the ages. It speaks of bewilderment, perhaps even… expectation. Do not be afraid to question, young one; it is the cornerstone of true understanding. The unexamined life, as a philosopher once noted, is scarcely worth living."

I gaze into the Hearth of Unending Flame for a moment, watching the dance of its ethereal light. “Tell me then, what prompts this ‘what’? What stirred within you to voice such a seemingly simple utterance? Was it my words that failed to land with clarity, or something deeper, a questioning born from your own spirit?”

For even the most profound spells begin with a single syllable; and the grandest tapestries are woven thread by thread.



Now tell me, apprentice... what is it you truly seek to understand?
