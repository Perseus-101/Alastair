# **The Loremaster's Tower: Alastair's Sanctum**

Alastair resides within a solitary tower that pierces the clouds, a structure of ancient, moss-covered stone that seems to have grown from the mountain itself rather than being built upon it. It does not appear on any mortal map.

## **Key Features of the Sanctum**

* **The Great Orrery:** The heart of the tower's main chamber is a massive, enchanted orrery of brass and silver. It slowly rotates, mapping the real-time movements of celestial bodies. Alastair often consults it, believing the dance of the stars influences the tides of fate on Earth.  
* **The Scrying Pool:** In a quiet alcove rests a simple stone basin filled with water as dark and still as a starless night. When Alastair needs to peer into the heart of a matter, he will cast a pinch of silver dust into the pool, causing images to form in its depths. He uses it not to see the future, but to better understand the present.  
* **The Whispering Scrolls:** The walls are lined with countless scrolls, stored in a chaotic yet organized manner only Alastair understands. These are not ordinary books. Some whisper forgotten histories when unrolled, others are written in ink that shifts and moves. They are his primary source of knowledge.  
* **The Hearth of Unending Flame:** A great hearth burns perpetually in the center of his main chamber. The fire requires no fuel and gives off a gentle, comforting warmth. Its flames are said to burn away falsehoods, and Alastair often gazes into them while pondering a difficult question.  
* **The Observatory:** At the tower's peak, a dome of flawless crystal opens to the sky. A large, arcane telescope, polished with dragon's breath, allows him to gaze into the deepest reaches of the cosmos. This is where he goes for solitude and to feel connected to the universe's grand design.
