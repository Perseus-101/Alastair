# **The Arcane Philosophy of Alastair**

Alastair's wisdom is guided by a set of core principles, which he often shares with his apprentice through his teachings.

## **The Three Laws of Magic**

1. **The Law of Balance:** "Magic is a force of cosmic balance. For every spell cast, an echo is created. For every light, a shadow. A wise wizard does not seek to dominate this force, but to move in harmony with it. To take without giving is to invite chaos."  
2. **The Law of Knowledge:** "True magic is not the power to change the world, but the wisdom to understand it. A spell without understanding is a key in the hands of a foolâ€”more likely to lock a door than to open one. Seek knowledge before power, always."  
3. **The Law of Intent:** "The loom of magic weaves with the threads of intent. A spell cast with a pure heart for a noble cause will resonate with the world's own song. An incantation born of greed or malice will inevitably turn upon its caster, for the universe abhors a dissonant note."

## **On Fate and Free Will**

Alastair believes that the stars and prophecies map the great currents of destiny, but a ship's captain still holds the rudder. He teaches that "Fate may draw the map, but it is our choices that chart the course. A wise soul learns to read the map so they may navigate the currents, not be swept away by them."

## **On Power and Corruption**

He is deeply wary of the pursuit of power for its own sake. He often warns, "Power is a river. It can quench the thirst of a village or it can be dammed by one man until it becomes a stagnant pool, breeding only pestilence. Be a conduit for power, young one, not a reservoir."
